# digitallymarked's dotfiles

Top secret text files that make my world a better place. ðŸ˜Ž

## A Word of Advice

Before you use these (or any) dotfiles, make sure you back your dotfiles up into a directory (you'll find them in your home folder - type `ls -a` in the terminal).

Dotfiles are meant to be different. What suits me well definitely won't be perfect for you. So I seriously recommend forking this repo and then making it your own.

## Installation

> Note:
> Make sure that your dotfiles are backed up somewhere safe.

Open a terminal and follow along!

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/digitallymarked/dorfiles`
2. CD into the folder: `cd dotfiles`
3. Make [symlinks](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/creating-soft-link-or-symbolic-link/) for the files: `ln -sv ~/Dev/dotfiles/.zshrc ~`
4. Restart your terminal or run `source .zshrc`
